While much of this work has been devoted to issues in applied ethics, a number of important essays have explored central themes within the tradition and clarified the theoretical foundations of Jewish ethics. This important text grew out of the need for a single work which accurately and conveniently reflects these developments within the field.,The first text of its kind in almost two decades, ,Contemporary Jewish Ethics and Morality, presents wide-ranging and carefully organized recent essays on Jewish ethical theory and practice. Serving as an introduction to Jewish ethics, it acquaints the student with the distinctive methodological issues involved and offers a sampling of Jewish positions on contemporary moral problems. The book features work from both traditionalist and liberal contributors, making this the only volume which encompasses the full range of contemporary Jewish ethical perspectives. Writers such as Harold Schulweis, Judith Plaskow, David Novak, David Hartman, and Blu Greenberg discuss law and ethics, natural law, humility, justice, sex and the family, euthanasia, and other vital issues relating to modern Judaism. Many of the readings appear here for the first time, making this important text the most timely sourcebook in its field. Uniquely qualified to reflect the high level and depth of contemporary work in this area of study, ,Contemporary Jewish Ethics and Morality, is an essential contribution to any course dealing with Jewish ethics.\n",

Jones told Lane he wanted to \"pull an Eldridge Cleaver\", referring to the fugitive Black Panther who was able to return to the USA after repairing his reputation. Lane visited Jonestown in 9/78 & spoke to residents who provided support for the theory that intelligence agencies conspired against them & drew parallels between Martin Luther King & Jim Jones. Lane then held press conferences stating \"none of the charges\" against the Temple \"are accurate or true\" & that there was a conspiracy against the Temple by \"intelligence organizations,\" naming the CIA, FBI, FCC & Post Office. Lane represented himself as disinterested, but the Temple paid him $6k monthly. Regarding the effect of the work of Lane & Freed upon members, Temple member Annie Moore wrote that \"Mom & Dad have probably shown you the latest about the conspiracy information that Mark Lane, the famous attorney in the ML King case & Don Freed the other famous author in the Kennedy case have come up with regarding activities planned against us--Peoples Temple.\" Another member, Carolyn Layton, wrote that Freed told them that \"anything this drug out could be nothing less than conspiracy\"., Lane was present in Jonestown during the events of 11/18/78, when over 900 Temple members died in murder-suicide by cyanide, & Rep. Leo Ryan & four others were murdered at a nearby airstrip. For months before that tragedy, Jones frequently created fear among members by stating that the CIA & other intelligence agencies were conspiring with \"capitalist pigs\" to destroy Jonestown & harm its members. This included mentions of CIA involvement in the address Jones gave the day before the arrival of Ryan., During the visit of Ryan, Lane helped represent the Temple with its other attorney, Charles R. Garry, who was furious with Lane for holding numerous press conferences & alleging the existence of conspiracies against the Temple. Garry was also displeased with him for making a veiled threat that the Temple might move to the USSR in a letter to Ryan., Late in the afternoon of 11/18, two men wielding rifles approached Lane & Garry, who'd earlier been sent to a small wooden house by Jones. It's unclear whether the men were sent to kill them, but one recognized Garry as an attorney in a trial he'd attended. After a friendly exchange, the men told Garry & Lane that they were going to \"commit revolutionary suicide\" to \"expose this racist & fascist society\". The gunmen then gave Garry & Lane directions to exit Jonestown. Garry & Lane hid in the jungle while events unfolded., On a tape made while members committed suicide by ingesting poisoned punch, the reason given by Jones to commit suicide was consistent with Jones' previously stated theories of intelligence organizations allegedly conspiring against the Temple, that men would \"parachute in here on us\", \"shoot some of our innocent babies\" & \"they'll torture our children, they'll torture some of our people here, they'll torture our seniors\". Parroting Jones' prior statements that hostile forces would convert captured children to Fascism, one temple member stated \"the ones that they take captured, they're gonna just let them grow up and be dummies\". Annie Moore & Carolyn Layton were among the 900 who died., Lane later wrote about the tragedy in The Strongest Poison. He reported hearing automatic weapons & suspects US forces killed Jonestown survivors. While Lane blames Jones & Temple leadership for the deaths, he also claims that US officials exacerbated the possibility of violence by employing agents provocateur. For example, Lane claimed that Temple attorney & later defector Timothy Stoen, who Lane alleged had repeatedly prompted the Temple to take radical action before defecting, \"had evidently led three lives\", one as a government informant.\n",

This is an introduction to extensions of first-order logic, based on the principle that many-sorted logic (MSL) provides a unifying framework in which to place, for example, second-order logic, type theory, modal and dynamic logics and MSL itself. The aim is two fold: only one theorem-prover is needed; proofs of the metaproperties of the different existing calculi can be avoided by borrowing them from MSL. To make the book accessible to readers from different disciplines, whilst maintaining precision, the author has supplied detailed step-by-step proofs, avoiding difficult arguments, and continually motivating the material with examples. Consequently this can be used as a reference, for self-teaching or for first-year graduate courses.\n",

But we are not as ethical as we think we are. In ,Blind Spots,, leading business ethicists Max Bazerman and Ann Tenbrunsel examine the ways we overestimate our ability to do what is right and how we act unethically without meaning to. From the collapse of Enron and corruption in the tobacco industry, to sales of the defective Ford Pinto, the downfall of Bernard Madoff, and the Challenger space shuttle disaster, the authors investigate the nature of ethical failures in the business world and beyond, and illustrate how we can become more ethical, bridging the gap between who we are and who we want to be.,Explaining why traditional approaches to ethics don't work, the book considers how blind spots like ethical fading--the removal of ethics from the decision--making process--have led to tragedies and scandals such as the ,Challenger, space shuttle disaster, steroid use in Major League Baseball, the crash in the financial markets, and the energy crisis. The authors demonstrate how ethical standards shift, how we neglect to notice and act on the unethical behavior of others, and how compliance initiatives can actually promote unethical behavior. They argue that scandals will continue to emerge unless such approaches take into account the psychology of individuals faced with ethical dilemmas. Distinguishing our should self (the person who knows what is correct) from our want self (the person who ends up making decisions), the authors point out ethical sinkholes that create questionable actions.,Suggesting innovative individual and group tactics for improving human judgment, ,Blind Spots, shows us how to secure a place for ethics in our workplaces, institutions, and daily lives.\n",
